# Checklist

## Topics

### Data Structures

* **Hashtables** - Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. Make sure you can implement one from scratch.
* **Stacks/Queues** are essential, know what FILO and FIFO are.
* **Linked Lists** - Know about singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular.
* **Trees** - Get to know basic tree/node construction, traversal (DFS and BFS) and manipulation algorithms. Learn about the subsets-- binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Lower-level o* senior programmers should know about balanced binary trees and their implementation.
* **Graphs** - Get to know all implementations (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) and their pros and cons.

### Algorithms

* **Sorting** - get to know the details of at least two n*log(n) sorting algorithm, I recommend Quicksort and Mergesort.
* **Binary Search**
* **Tree/Graph traversal algorithms**: Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search are musts. Also know inorder, postorder, preorder.
* **Advanced** - for the most part optional, but if you wanted to go beyond the basics, I'd recommend Dijkstra, A*, Traveling Salesman, Knapsack Problem.

## Math

* Basic discrete math (logic, set theory, etc.)
* Counting problems
* Probability (permutations vs. combinations)

## OOP Design

* **Polymorphism**
* **Abstraction**
* **Encapsulation**
* **Inheritance**
