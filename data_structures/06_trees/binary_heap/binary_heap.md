# Binary Heap

| Operation | Worst case  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| space     | `O(n)`      |
| insert    | `O(log(n))` |
| delete    | `O(log(n))` |
| search    | `O(n)`      |

* **Heap**: a *heap* is a small collection or group. It's a specialized tree-based data structure, where the largest or smallest element is at the top.
  * Used to implement *priority queues*.
  * Used with *graph traversal algorithms*.

* **Types**:
  * *Max heap*: parent nodes are always larger than child nodes, the root node has the *highest value* or priority.
  * *Min heap*: parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes, the root node has the *lowest value* or priority.

* **Binary heap**: commonly used when ordering is important, like in *priority queues*.

* **Max binary heap**:
  * Each parent has at most two child nodes.
  * The value of each parent node is *always* greater than its child nodes.
  * In a Max Binary Heap the parent is *greater* than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
  * A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.

## Strenghts and Weaknesses

* **Strenghts**:
  * *Space efficient*: size is flexible.
  * *Always balanced*: insertions are always left-to-right, so they preserve insertion order.
  * *Fast insertions and deletions*: insertion and deletion are very fast (`O(log(n))`).
  * *Good at comparisons*: binary heaps are good at doing comparative operations, like grabbing a set of values greater than or lesser than `x`. If using a binary-search tree, we would need to traverse the entire tree.
  * *Good at finding maximum/minimum value*: finding the root node is always `O(1)`.
* **Weaknesses**:
  * *Slow searches*: search is `O(n)`, unlike binary-search trees, where the smaller value is on the left child and the greater value is on the right child, in *binary heaps*, the left and right children can be any value as long as it's smaller/greater than the top value, so when traversing we need to check *both sides*, losing `O(log(n))`.

## Pseudocode

* **Insert**:

```
Push the value into the values property on the heap
Bubble Up:
  Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
  Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2
  Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
    Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
    Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over
```

* **Remove**: also called `extractMax`.
  * *Note*: *sink down* is the procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called *down-heap* (also known as *bubble-down*, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max).

```
Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...â€‹
  Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
  Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
  Find the index of the right child: 2 * index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
  If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child.
  The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.
  Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
  Return the old root
```
