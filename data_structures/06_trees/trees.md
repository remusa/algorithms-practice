# Trees

* **Tree**: *abstract data type (ADT)* that simulates a hierarchal tree
  structure, with a *root* value and *subtrees* of children with a parent node,
  represented as a set of linked nodes.
* Can be defined *recursively* as a collection of nodes (starting at the root
  node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a *value* and
  *references to nodes (the children)*, with the constraint that no reference is
  duplicated, and none points to the root.
* *Linked lists* are a kind of trees with only 1 child per node.

## Concepts

* *Root*: first node.
* *Parent*: node with children.
* *Children*: descendants of a parent (can only have 1).
* *Leaf*: final node.
* *Siblings*: nodes that share the same parent.
