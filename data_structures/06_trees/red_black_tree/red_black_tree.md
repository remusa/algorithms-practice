# Red/Black Tree

| Operation | Worst case  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| space     | `O(n)`      |
| access    | `O(log(n))` |
| search    | `O(log(n))` |
| insert    | `O(log(n))` |
| delete    | `O(log(n))` |

* *Self-balancing tree*: each node has an extra color property with a value of `red` or
  `black`. All children of a parent node must have the same color.
* *Balancing*: balancing is done by painting each node of the tree with one of
  the two colors. When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and
  repainted.
* *Guarantees (O(log(n)))*: balancing of the tree is not perfect, but it guarantees searching in `O(log(n))` time, where `n` is the total number of elements in the tree.
