# Sorting

* In JavaScript:
  * `sort()` sorts the elements of an array *in place* and returns
  the sorted array (*mutates* the original array).
  * `sort()` converts numbers to strings by grabbing the character code at the
    first index.

```javascript
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'r']
const basket = [2, 65, 34, 2, 1, 7, 8]

const spanish = ['√∫nico', '√°rbol', 'cosas', 'f√∫tbol']

spanish.sort((a, b) => {
    return a.localeCompare(b)
})
```

## Stability in sorting algorithms

* **Stability**: a sorting algorithm is stable if two objects with equal keys
  appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the input
  array.
* A *stable* sort preserves the original order of the input set, whereas the *unstable* algorithm does not distinguish between two or more items.
* *Stable algorithms*:
  * Bubble Sort.
  * Insertion Sort.
  * Merge Sort.
  * Counting Sort.
  * Tim Sort.
* *Unstable algorithms*:
  * Heap Sort.
  * Selection Sort.
  * Shell Sort.
  * Quick Sort.
* Stability matters *if, and only if*, the problem to solve requires
  retention of that relative order. If we don't need stability, we can use a
  fast, memory-sipping algorithm like *quicksort* or *heapsort*.

## Picking a sorting algorithm

* Note: it's *matematically impossible* to beat `O(n log(n))`, because it means
  we have to sort by comparison.

* **Bubble sort**: teaching purposes (almost never).
* **Selection sort**: teaching purposes (almost never).
* **Insertion sort**: if the *input is small* or items are *already or almost sorted*.
* **Merge sort**: *very fast* (average and worst cases are both `O(nlog(n))`).
  Space complexity can be a problem in large data sets.
* **Quick sort**: if *memory space* is a problem (very large data sets). Better
  than *merge sort* if pivot is picked properly. Worst case is really slow
  `O(n^2)`.
* **Heap sort**: better space complexity than *quick sort*, but slower on average.

* **Radix sort**: *non-comparison sort* algorithm.
* **Counting sort**: *non-comparison sort* algorithm.

```javascript
//#1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:
Insertion sort (small dataset)

//#2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount:
Radix or counting sort (bids are fixed-length integers)

//#3 - Sport scores on ESPN
Quick sort (efficient in time/space complexity, scores probably aren't already sorted)

//#4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data
Merge sort (worst case is better than quick sort and we aren't sorting in memory)

//#5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews
Insertion sort (old reviews are probably already sorted)

//#6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada
Radix or counting sort (if temperatures have no decimal places)
Quick sort (if decimal places)

//#7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random.
Merge sort (if we have enough memory)
Quick sort (if not worried about worst case and I can pick a good pivot)

//#8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time
Bubble sort, selection sort
```
