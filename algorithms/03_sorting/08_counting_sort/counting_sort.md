# Counting Sort

| Counting Sort | Worst case | Average case | Best case | Space  | Stable |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| complexity    | `O(n+k)`   | `Θ(n+k)`     | `Ω(n+k)`  | `O(k)` | `no`   |

- **Counting Sort**: .
- _Non-comparison algorithm_.
- _Unstable algorithm_: does not distinguish between two or more items, even if they're equivalent.
- _Only works with integers_: restricted range (fixed-length integers) because of the way numbers
  are stored in memory.
