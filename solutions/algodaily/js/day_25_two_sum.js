/*
    This is a classic and very common interview problem. Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers in it that add up to a specific goal number.

    So let's say our goal number was 10. Our numbers to sum to it would be 3 and 7, and their indices 1 and 3 respectively.

    let arr = [1, 3, 6, 7, 9];
    let goal = 10;
    twoSum(arr, goal); // [1, 3]
    â€‹
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. Additionally, you may not use the same element twice towards the sum. This means if given [1, 3] and a goal of 2, you cannot use 1 twice and return [0, 0].
