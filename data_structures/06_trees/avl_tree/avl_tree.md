# AVL Tree

| Operation | Average case | Worst case  |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| space     | `O(n)`       | `O(n)`      |
| access    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(log(n))` |
| search    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(log(n))` |
| insert    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(log(n))` |
| delete    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(log(n))` |

- _Self-balancing tree_: when a value is inserted, it goes back and _rotates_ the level of the tree.
  The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by _at most one_. If at any time they
  differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
- _Guarantees (O(log(n)))_: balancing guarantees searching in `O(log(n))` time, where `n` is the
  total number of elements in the tree.
- Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
