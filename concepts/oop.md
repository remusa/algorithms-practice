# Object-Oriented Programming

* **Object**: basic entity.
* **Class**: blueprint/prototype that defines properties and methods common to all objects of a certain kind.
* *Properties/attributes*: properties.
* *Methods*: behavior.

4 core concepts:
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Abstraction
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Inheritance

## Encapsulation

* **Encapsulation**: all the data members (variables, attributes/properties) & behaviors(functions/methods) are gathered together and closed. A *class* is an example.
* Only exposes the necessary attributes and methods and restricts access of the rest to the outside world.

## Abstraction

* **Abstraction**: exposes necessary features without explaining the details.
* **Data abstraction**: separates *interface* and *implementation*. This data abstraction can be archived from using 2 different classes while coding using OOP:
  * *Abstraction class*:  (0-100)% abstraction.
  * *Interface class*:  100% abstraction.

## Inheritance

* **Inheritance**: a class (*derived class*) can inherit properties and methods from its parent class (*base class*).
* Children can have its own properties and methods.

## Polymorphism

* **Polymorphism**: same function implementation but using *different arguments*.
