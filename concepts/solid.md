# S.O.L.I.D. Design Principles

The 5 most important software design principles are:
    1. **S for the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)**: classes should be responsible for one, and only one actor.
    2. **O for the Open/Closed Principle(OCP)**: code should be easy to extend by ensuring that it stays open for extension but closed for modification (this might be the most important of all 5).
    3. **L for the Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)**: keeps semantic consistency in complex inheritance hierarchies, making classes easier to understand and use.
    4. **I for the Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)**: protects objects from depending on the behavior they don't really need.
    5. **D for the Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)**: controls the direction of dependencies in the code, ensuring that it always flows in the direction of more abstract entities.
