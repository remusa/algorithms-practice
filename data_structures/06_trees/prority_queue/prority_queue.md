# Priority Queue

| Operation | Worst case  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| space     | `O(n)`      |
| search    | `O(log(n))` |
| insert    | `O(log(n))` |
| delete    | `O(log(n))` |

* **Priority queue**: abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack, but where each element has a *priority*.
* *Priority-based output*: elements with high priority are served before an element with low priority.
* If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
* Typically implemented using *binary heaps*, but being an abstract data type it can be
  implemented using other data structures, like an *unordered array*.
