# Problem Solving Approach

- Steps:
  1. Understand the Problem.
  2. Explore Concrete Examples.
  3. Break It Down.
  4. Solve/Simplify.
  5. Look Back and Refactor.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Step 2: Explore Concrete Examples

* Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better.
* Examples also  provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
* User Stories.
* Unit Tests.

- Steps:
  1. Start with Simple Examples.
  2. Progress to More Complex Examples.
  3. Explore Examples with Empty Inputs.
  4. Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs.
  5. Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
