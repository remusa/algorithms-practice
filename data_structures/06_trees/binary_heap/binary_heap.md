# Binary Heap

| Operation | Average case | Worst case |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| space     | `O(n)`       | `O(n)`     |
| access    | `O(n)`       | `O(n)`     |
| search    | `O(n)`       | `O(n)`     |
| insert    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(n)`     |
| delete    | `O(log(n))`  | `O(n)`     |

* **Binary heap**: commonly used when ordering is important.

* **Max heap**: the root node has the *highest value* or priority.
* **Min heap**: the root node has the *lowest value* or priority.
