# Graphs

| Operation | Worst case  |
| --------- | ----------- |
| space     | `O(n)`      |
| access    | `O(log(n))` |
| search    | `O(log(n))` |
| insert    | `O(log(n))` |
| delete    | `O(log(n))` |

* **Graphs**: organizes items in an interconnected network.
  * *Nodes or vertex*: each item in the graph.
  * *Edges*: connection between the nodes.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

* **Strengths**:
  * *Representing links*: graphs are ideal for working with *interconnected things*. Examples:
    * Cities and highways.
    * Routers and ethernet cables.
    * Social network users.
    * Recommendation systems.
* **Weaknesses**:
  * *Slow*: most graph algorithms are `O(nlog(n))` or slower.

## Concepts

### Directed or Undirected

* **Directed**: edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end.
* **Undirected**: edges simply connect nodes at each end.

### Cyclic or Acyclic

* **Cyclic**: a *cycle* is a serie of unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itsef.
* **Ayclic**: a graph without cycles.

### Weighted or Unweighted

* **Weighted**: when each node has a *weight* (a value, like distance, cost or time).
* **Unweighted**: graphs without cycles.

### Legal coloring

* **Graph coloring**: when colors are assigned to each node in a graph.
* *Legal coloring*: no adjacent nodes have the same color.

## Graph Representations

* `|V|`: number of vertices.
* `|E|`: number of edges.

| Operation     | Adjacency list  | Adjacency matrix  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| add vertex    | `O(1)`          | `O(V^2)`          |
| remove vertex | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`            |
| add edge      | `O(V + E)`      | `O(V^2)`          |
| remove edge   | `O(E)`          | `O(1)`            |
| query         | `O(V + E)`      | `O(1)`            |
| storage       | `O(V + E)`      | `O(V^2)`          |

* **Adjacency list**:
  * Can take less space (in sparse graphs).
  * Faster to iterate over all edges.
  * Can be slower to lookup specific edge.
* **Adjacency matrix**:
  * Takes more space (in sparse graphs).
  * Slower to iterate over all edges.
  * Faster to lookup specific edge.

### Edge list

* **Edge list**: a list of all the edges in the graph.

```javascript
const graph = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
```

### Adjacency list

* **Adjacency list**: a list that represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node's neighbors.
  * Can be represented with a list(array) or an object.

```javascript
// Array
const graph = [
  [1],        // node 1
  [0, 2, 3],  // node 2
  [1, 3],     // node 3
  [1, 2],     // node 4
]

// Object
const graph = {
  0: [1],
  1: [0, 2, 3],
  2: [1, 3],
  3: [1, 2],
}
```

### Adjacency matrix

* **Adjacency matrix**: a matrix of `1`s and `0`s that indicate whether node `x` connects to node `y` (`0` is no, `1` is yes).
  * `O(n)`:

```javascript
const graph = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0], // 0
  [1, 0, 1, 1], // 1
  [0, 1, 0, 1], // 2
  [0, 1, 1, 0], // 3
]
```

## Algorithms

* Finding the shortest path: BFS.
* If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS.
* If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (DFS will take a long time).
* If the tree is very wide: DFS (BFS will need too much memory).
* If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS.
* Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS.

* Is there a path between two nodes in this undirected graph? Run DFS or BFS from one node and see if you reach the other one.
* What's the shortest path between two nodes in this undirected, unweighted graph? Run BFS from one node and backtrack once you reach the second. Note: BFS always finds the shortest path, assuming the graph is undirected and unweighted. DFS does not always find the shortest path.
* Can this undirected graph be colored with two colors? Run BFS, assigning colors as nodes are visited. Abort if we ever try to assign a node a color different from the one it was assigned earlier.
* Does this undirected graph have a cycle? Run BFS, keeping track of the number of times we're visiting each node. If we ever visit a node twice, then we have a cycle.

## Graph Traversals

### Breadth-first Traversal

* Uses a *queue*.
* Start at one vertex and visit all of its neighbors.
* Once all neighbors have been visited, visit each of their neighbors.

```
bfs(vertex)
  result_list = []
  queue = []
  queue.queue(root)

  while queue != empty:
    vertex = queue.dequeue()

    if vertex != discovered:
      visit vertex (add to result_list)
      label vertex as discovered

      for each neighbor of vertex's neighbors:
        queue.queue(neighbor)
end bfs
```

### Depth-first Traversal

* Uses a *stack*.
* Start at one vertex and follow one neighbor before visiting its siblings.
* Once there's no more siblings, backtrack to an unvisited vertex.
* **NOTE**: recursive and iterative results will be differents because the iterative version will start working with the last vertex of the stack in the adjacency list.

```
dfs_recursive(vertex)
  stack = []

  if vertex = Ã¸:
    return

  add vertex to stack
  mark vertex as visited

  for each neighbor in vertex's neighbors:
    if neighbor != visited:
      dfs_recursive(neighbor)
end dfs_recursive

dfs_iterative(root)
  result_list = []
  stack = []
  stack.push(root)

  while stack != empty:
    vertex = stack.pop()

    if vertex != discovered:
      visit vertex (add to result_list)
      label vertex as discovered

      for each neighbor of vertex's neighbors:
        stack.push(neighbor)
end dfs_iterative
```

## Advanced Algorithms

* **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
* **Topological Sort**: arranges the nodes in a directed, acyclic graph in a special order based on incoming edges.
* **Minimum Spanning Tree**: finds the cheapest set of edges needed to reach all nodes in a weighted graph.

## Shortest path algorithms

* Useful when finding shortest path, but unlike *BFS*, they take into account weights.

* **Dijkstra**:
  * Determines the shortest path from one node in a graph to *every other node* within the same graph, provided that the nodes are reachable from the starting node.
  * *Faster than Bellman-Ford*: on average.
* **Bellman-Ford**:
  * Can accomodate *negative weights*.
  * *Slow*: time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
