/*
    Suppose we're given an array of numbers like the following:

    [4, 2, 4]

    Could you find the majority element? A majority is defined as "the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements."

    Let's assume that the array length is always at least one, and that there's always a majority element.

    In the example above, the majority element would be 4.
